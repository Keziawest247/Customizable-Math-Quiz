# Mini Project - Customizable-Math-Quiz

A Python program that generates a math quiz based on user-selected difficulty, number of questions, and preferred operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or a mix). 
Helps users practice math skills interactively.

I used random module / ra.randint, while and for loops, and a driver function to create dynamic and customizable quizzes. 
Implemented try/except blocks for error handling and input validation. 
Strengthened logic-building through if, elif, and else structures. 
Gained experience designing interactive user experiences and building reusable program structure.
